### Abstract:
Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a subfield of machine learning (ML) that focusses on training agents to make sequential decisions in dynamic environments to maximise cumulative rewards. Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) provide a fundamental framework for modelling and solving RL problems. This report aims to explore the concepts and implications of MDPs in the context of RL, specifically focusing on finite and infinite MDPs.
